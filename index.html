                <h2>1. Generate Cash Quickly At No Cost</h2>
                <p>Do you have a product/service that could help give a boost to healthcare heroes? We created a platform called <a href="https://www.easyeventplanning.com/honor-and-thank/">HonorAndThank.com</a> where anyone can post a message (text, video or image) to a healthcare hero. Once someone has submitted a message, they will see a pop-up that lists local vendors who could send a meal, flowers, balloons, desserts etc. You would just need to complete the “Sell healthcare hero” field when you complete your category profile and indicate how someone can place an order with you. There is no charge and we’re not involved in the transaction. You can <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Frm5gUWJoFVOy_092TO31rmDL8XEyKYPPvwsIe5IRI/edit">use this press release</a> to promote this in your area.</p>
