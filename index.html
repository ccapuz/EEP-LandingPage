                    <p>Do you have a product/service that could help give a boost to healthcare heroes? We created a
                        platform called <a
                            href="https://www.easyeventplanning.com/honor-and-thank/">HonorAndThank.com</a> where anyone
                        can post a message (text, video or image) to a healthcare hero. Once someone has submitted a
                        message, they will see a pop-up that lists local vendors who could send a meal, flowers,
                        balloons, desserts etc. You would just need to complete the “Sell healthcare hero” field when
                        you complete your category profile and indicate how someone can place an order with you. There
                        is no charge and we’re not involved in the transaction. You can <a
